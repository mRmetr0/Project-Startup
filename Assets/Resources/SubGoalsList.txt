Talking with strangers
Ask for the time
stop someone on the street or in a store to ask for the time You could change it up by also asking about a specific location you are looking for.
give out a compliment
brighten up somebody’s day by complimenting something that they have done or something that you like about their appearance.  A simple, sincere comment is enough to make great impact
place an order at a restaurant
call a restaurant to order something from their menu. prepare first hand what you would like to order before calling them.
go to a public place
adapt to more public places such as plazas, cafes, train stations or other places  choose a good place to sit so you’ll be able to see a variety of people at a relatively close distance. 
 dedicate an hour to just observing your surroundings without distracting yourself  describe the setting, where are you, what kinds of people are there, what do they do or don’t do?
